Analisis Descriptivo Series de Tiempo

## Gráfico de una Serie de tiempo

Vamos a analizar de forma descriptiva algunas serie de tiempo.
Empezaremos por la serie de desempleo de los Estados Unidos que viene en
el paquete TSstudio.

``` r
library(TSstudio)
data(USUnRate)
ts_info(USUnRate)
```

    ##  The USUnRate series is a ts object with 1 variable and 864 observations
    ##  Frequency: 12 
    ##  Start time: 1948 1 
    ##  End time: 2019 12

``` r
plot(USUnRate,main = "US Monthly Unemployment Rate",ylab="Unemployment Rate (%)")
```

![](Descriptivo_files/figure-gfm/DesempleoUS-1.png)<!-- --> La serie es
medida mensula, es decir, presenta una frecuencia de 12. Qué
carcaterísticas podemos observar? \* Tendencia? \* Estacionalidad? \*
Cíclos? \* Varianza marginal no constante? Vamos a seleccionar un
periodo de tiempo mas corto

``` r
# unemployment <- window(USUnRate, start = c(1990,1))
#   ts_plot(unemployment,
#           title = "US Monthly Unemployment Rate",
#           Ytitle = "Unemployment Rate (%)",
#           Xtitle = "Year",
#           Xgrid = TRUE,
#Ygrid = TRUE)
```

Note que aquí podemos ver varias características: Estacionalidad(no es
tan evidente), tres periodos de cíclos, el primero de 1990 a 2000,el
segundo de 2000 a 2007, y el tercero de 2007 a 2019. No parece tener una
hetocedasticidad marginal.

Veamos ahora la tasa de desempleo de Colombia. Hay que hacerle un ajuste
a la base de datos porque está en order descendente en el tiempo.

``` r
library(astsa)
library(TSstudio)
data(chicken)
ts_info(chicken)
```

    ##  The chicken series is a ts object with 1 variable and 180 observations
    ##  Frequency: 12 
    ##  Start time: 2001 8 
    ##  End time: 2016 7

``` r
plot(chicken,main="Precio Mensual de la Libra de Pollo en Estados Unidos", ylab="Precio en Centavos de Dólar")

tendencia creciente al parecer lineal, es decir

o mas específicamente

*y*<sub>*t*</sub> = *β*<sub>0</sub> + *β*<sub>1</sub>*t* + *a*<sub>*t*</sub>

## Transformación de Box-Cox para Estabilizar la Varianza Marginal

En ocaciones la serie presenta varianza marginal no constante a lo largo
del tiempo, lo cual hace necesario tener en cuenta tal caracaterística.
En este caso, se siguiere hacer una transformación de potencia para
estabilizar la varianza. Esta familia de transformaciones se llaman
transformaciones Box-Cox.

``` r
data("AirPassengers")
plot(AirPassengers)
```

## Gráficas de Retardos

Vamos a hacer gráficos de dispersión para chequear que tipos de
relaciones hay entre los retardos de la variable interés. Vamos a
trabajar con algunas series, por ejemplo: \* Índice ambiental mensual
(soi)(Southern Oscillation Index), el cual mide los cambios en la
presión del aire, relacionados con las temperaturas de la superficie del
mar en el Océano Pacífico central. \* la serie rec (reclutamiento
asociada al soi), número de nuevos peces. \* Consumo mensual de gas
natural en EE. UU.(USgas) medido en Billones de pies cúbicos. Esto
permite chequear si hay posibles relaciones no-lineales.

``` r
library(astsa)
data("soi")
ts_info(soi)
```

    ##  The soi series is a ts object with 1 variable and 453 observations
    ##  Frequency: 12 
    ##  Start time: 1950 1 
    ##  End time: 1987 9

``` r
?soi

par(mar = c(2,2,2,2))
plot(soi, main="Indice soi")
```

![](Descriptivo_files/figure-gfm/dispersión%20retardos_1-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
par(mar = c(3,2,3,2))
astsa::lag1.plot(soi, 12)  ###El 12 indica cuantos retardos y_t-k contra y_t 
```

![](Descriptivo_files/figure-gfm/dispersión%20retardos_1-2.png)<!-- -->

``` r
###Hacer la gráfica con x11()
```

``` r
#pdf('/Users/sergiocalderon/Documents/Documentos - iMac de Sergio/Documentos iMac Sergio/Notas de Clase/Notas de clase/Notas de Clase Series de Tiempo Univariadas/Graficas/DispersionSoiRec.pdf',paper="USr")
par(mar = c(3,2,3,2))
lag2.plot(soi, rec, 8)   #El 2 de lag2.plot es porque intervenienen dos serie de tiempo.
```

![](Descriptivo_files/figure-gfm/dispersion%20retardos_2-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
#dev.off()
lag2.plot(soi, rec, 8,corr=F)
```

![](Descriptivo_files/figure-gfm/dispersion%20retardos_2-2.png)<!-- -->
Note que con la función ts\_lags de TSstudio podemos hacer una gráfica
similar.

``` r
ts_lags(soi,lags=1:12)
```

## La función de autocorrelación simple o gráfico ACF

Cuando el proceso es estacionario, o al menos nompresenta tendencia,
podemos usar el gráfico acf para explorar las posibles relaciones
lineales a diferentes rezagos. En seguida mostramos la función de
autocorrelación para el índice soi y la serie de nuevos peces.
